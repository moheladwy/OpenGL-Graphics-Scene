## Introduction

This project represents the culmination of extensive effort and dedication to creating a robust and visually impressive graphics scene. It covers fundamental and advanced aspects of OpenGL, including lighting, shading, texture mapping, and more. The aim is to provide a comprehensive example that can serve as a reference for anyone interested in OpenGL graphics programming.

## Features

-   Realistic Lighting Models: Implementations of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.

-   Texture Mapping: Application of textures to 3D models to enhance visual fidelity.
    Advanced Shading: Use of vertex and fragment shaders for fine-grained control over rendering.

-   Camera Control: Interactive camera manipulation to navigate through the scene.
    Object Transformations: Scaling, rotation, and translation of objects within the scene.

-   Performance Optimizations: Techniques to ensure smooth and efficient rendering.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moheladwy/OpenGL-Graphics-Scene.git OpenGL-Graphics-Scene
```

Open the project directory using Visual Studio and configure the project settings. You may need to adjust the include directories and library paths to match your system setup:

-   Install dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed, such as GLFW and GLAD. You can typically install these via package managers or download them directly.

-   Build the project: Depending on your development environment using Visual Studio.

-   Run the project: Once the project is built successfully, you can run the executable to launch the graphics scene.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the graphics scene using the following controls:

W/A/S/D: Move the camera forward, left, backward, and right.
Mouse Movement: Rotate the camera.
Q/E: Move the camera up and down.
Esc: Exit the application.
Experiment with different views and appreciate the intricate details implemented in the scene.
